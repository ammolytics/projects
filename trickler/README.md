This is a free, open-source project which does not come with any official support or warranty.


## Software

The Mobile app for this project uses the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/). The code can be found in the [`mobile/`](https://github.com/ammolytics/projects/blob/develop/trickler/mobile/) directory.

The Controller is a [NodeJS (`v12.x`)](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/) application which reads from the scale's serial port and controls the trickler. It was designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The code can be found in the [`peripheral/`](https://github.com/ammolytics/projects/blob/develop/trickler/peripheral/) directory.
