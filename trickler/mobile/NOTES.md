## Setup

I did the following from a new laptop:

- Sign into account through XCode

- Download and install certificates from Apple Connect

- Run `flutter doctor` to find issues

- Install CocoaPods
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

- Fix pods
```
pod setup
```

- Download and install  
  - Android Studio (and plugins)
  - Dart SDK
